Hi my name is Ryan Urbanski

I was working as a Project Engineer in Pennsylvania designing HVAC and renewable energy systems
and outside my normal role developed an automated kpi tracking system to make our business data actionable.

In the process I realized I had more fun solving these problems than the work I was getting paid
for and started the switch to a career in software development.

I returned to Penn State to earn my IST degree from their World Campus and recently began an intenisve 
bootcamp at Momentum
